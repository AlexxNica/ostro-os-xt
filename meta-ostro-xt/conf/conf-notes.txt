Ostro OS XT common targets are:
    ostro-xt-image-noswupd (when building without swupd,
                            the recommended mode for local image building)
    ostro-xt-image-swupd   (when building with swupd, the recommended mode
                            for deployment)

These are full-featured images with most components pre-installed. The
development packages (header files, etc.) and build tools (compiler,
autotools, etc.) are also part of the images, making them suitable for
on-target compilation.

In addition, images from Ostro OS also work:
    ostro-image-noswupd (This is a minimal Ostro OS image with fewer components
                         than ostro-xt-image-noswupd. Because of its reduced
                         build time, it is especially recommended for people
                         working on the core OS and kernel using the Yocto Project
                         build tools. It is not suitable for on-target development.)
